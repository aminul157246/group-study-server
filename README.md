## Features of my website : 
Certainly! Creating an educational website with features tailored to students' needs is a commendable endeavor. Here are some essential features you might consider incorporating into your website:

### 1. **Assignment Submission Portal**:
   - A dedicated section where students can easily submit their assignments. Ensure it's user-friendly and allows file uploads (such as PDFs or Word documents).

### 2. **User Authentication and Profiles**:
   - Implement secure user authentication (e.g., login via email or social media) to protect student data.
   - Each student should have a personalized profile where they can view their submitted assignments, track progress, and update their details.

### 3. **Assignment Management**:
   - Enable students to view a list of their submitted assignments.
   - Provide options to edit or delete assignments (if allowed by the instructor).

### 4. **Responsive Design**:
   - My website looks great and functions well on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

### 5. **Privacy and Data Security**:
    - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations  
    - Safeguard student information and prevent unauthorized access.
